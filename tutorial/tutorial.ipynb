    "This diagram shows, similar to the previous plot, the assembly path of the three protein chains. In the beginning, all chains are unbound (state 0). After a while, two chains form a dimer (state 2). Finally, the trimeric complex is formed (state 3). These results should be very consistent with the results above. *(If the complete assembly does not happen in your simulation, you were quite unlucky. You may extend the simulation, or restart the simulation completely.)*  \n",
